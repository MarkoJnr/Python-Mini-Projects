# Mini Projects
Welcome to "Mini-Projects"! This repository is a collection of small, self-contained Python projects that I have developed to practice and improve my programming skills. The projects cover a wide range of topics, including data analysis, web scraping, and machine learning, and are designed to be both fun and challenging.

Each project includes a detailed README file that explains the problem statement, outlines the approach I took to solve it, and provides instructions on how to run the code. I have also included comments throughout the code to help others understand my thought process and learn from my code.

I have created this repository to share my projects with the wider Python community, and to collaborate with other developers on improving the code and exploring new ideas. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn Python or an experienced developer looking for new challenges, I hope you find these mini-projects informative and enjoyable. Feel free to fork the repository and contribute your own projects or suggest improvements to mine. Happy coding!
