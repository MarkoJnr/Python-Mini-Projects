## Rollercoaster Ticketing System

This is a simple Python program that simulates a ticketing system for a rollercoaster. 

The program asks the user for their height in centimeters, checks if they are tall enough to ride the rollercoaster (minimum height required is 120cm), and then determines the price of their ticket based on their age. 

The ticket prices are £3 for a child's ticket (age 12 or younger), £5 for a youth ticket (ages 13-18), and £7 for an adult ticket (ages 19 or older). 

The program also asks if the user wants a photo, and if they do, the ticket price is increased by £3.

## How to Use

Run the program by opening it in a Python interpreter or IDE.

When prompted, enter your height in centimeters.

If you are tall enough to ride the rollercoaster (120cm or taller), enter your age when prompted.

The program will then display the price of your ticket based on your age.

If you want a photo, type "Yes" when prompted. The ticket price will be updated accordingly.

The program will display the final ticket price and a message to enjoy the ride!

## How It Works

The program uses simple conditional statements to determine if the user is tall enough to ride the rollercoaster, and then determines the price of their ticket based on their age using an if-elif-else statement. 

The program then asks if the user wants a photo, and if they do, the ticket price is updated using a conditional statement.

 Finally, the program displays the final ticket price and a message to enjoy the ride!
